# DICE ROLLER
The project is a simple dice roller, intended for use as a component to be used in other applications. Currently a work in progress, but look forward to publication on npm.

### Features
1. DropDown Selection Menu - choose from preset rolls or customize
2. Roll Button - shows result from each die and total value
3. Exploding Toggle - optionally have dice roll again on max value
4. Custom artwork - it's gotta look good

### Instructions
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`

Create React App will automatically open up a window for you to start rolling.
Currently there are 4 active styles on display, easily passed into the component via an option prop.
1. classic
2. jewel
3. earth
4. blueSteel

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
